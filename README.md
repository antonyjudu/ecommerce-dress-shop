# 🛍️ Ecommerce Dress Shop (MERN Full-Stack Project)

This is a **full-stack ecommerce web application** I built from scratch using the **MERN stack**.  
It demonstrates my ability to design and implement a **scalable, production-ready shopping platform** with authentication, payments, and admin management.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Users can **browse products, add to cart, checkout, and pay securely**.
- Built an **Admin Dashboard** to manage products, orders, and view transactions.
- Integrated **Stripe and Razorpay** payment gateways (with test/demo mode).
- Deployed **Frontend on Vercel** and **Backend on Render** with a connected **MongoDB Atlas** database.
- Secured with **JWT Authentication** and **role-based access control**.

This project highlights my skills in **React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, TailwindCSS, authentication, and payment integration**.
